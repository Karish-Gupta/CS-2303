Main(): 
Initialize year vairable and starting day variable 
Print prompt to terminal 
Prompt user for input and retrieves the year
Calls starting day function and retrives starting day integer
Calls print calendar and passes the year and starting day 
return 0

printCalendar(): 

Iterates using a for loop 12 times and calls printMonth()
Passes i as the month variable
Returns void


printMonth(): 

Initialize variable dayOfWeek
Print name of the month and year by calling printMonthName
Print the days of the week with two spaces between each name

Create a for loop that iterates from i = 0 to the dayOfWeek and print 5 spaces
Create a for loop that iterates from n = starting day to the number


printMonthName():

Initialize variable num_day without any value

Create switch statements with 12 different cases (Cases 0 to 11)
For each case if the given int month matches with the case number, print the relevent month name and the year parameter
Set num_day equal to the number of days representative of the given month 

Within case 1 for Febuary: If the year is divisible by 4 and the year is not divisble by 100
or the year is divisible by 100 and 400 
Then print: 
Febuary (year)
This month has 29 days
else print: 
Febuary (year)
This month has 28 days

return variable num_day



Note that each 
number uses 5 spaces and that two spaces separate the names of the days from each other.
