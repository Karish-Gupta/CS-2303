coffee_shop.c:

Initialize variables: int operation 

prompt user for options 1, 2, 3

Operation 1: 
call overall_revenue(FILE *f1)
return float valuez

Operation 2: 
call float balance(FILE *f1)
return float value

Operation 3: 
call tally(FILE *f1, inyt item)
Prompt user: 
Which item to analyze?
What is the output file?
Enter A for append or O for over-write.
If A, then append sales for item 
If O, then overwrite ouput file withe sales for item

register.c:

float overall_revenue(FILE *f1):

Initialize variables: item code, item price, overall revenue
While loop that checks if both int and float have been scanned
If statement that checks if the item number is 0
Remove the day's starting balance from overall revenue
Add item price to running sum 
Return running sum

float balance(FILE *f1):

Initialize variables: item code, item price, balance
While loop that checks if both int and float have been scanned
Remove the day's starting balance from overall revenue
Add item price to running sum 
Return running sum

int tally(FILE *f1, int item)

Initialize variables: item code, item price, count
While loop that checks if both int and float have been scanned
If statement that checks if the item number is the same as the given item number
If true then increase count by 1
Return count
